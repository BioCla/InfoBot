// Main file that initializes everything, sets up the shard manager and initializes everything from the `bot.js`
// https://discordjs.guide/sharding/
// https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/gateway#sharding
// This is just the shard manager, the actual client is in `bot.js`
// All this isn't really necessary if the bot resides in less than 2000 servers, it was just a 
// proof of concept to help the user to understand sharding as well as how to set it up
//
// Bots, even without shard manager, reside on the 0 indexed shard either way
// If you want to remove sharding just delete this file (or move it to the assets folder) 
// and rename `bot.js` to `index.js`
